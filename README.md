# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
The Traffic Sign Recognition project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify traffic signs from the GTSRB dataset. The model is trained with image preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to improve accuracy and robustness. It can be applied in autonomous driving and intelligent transport systems.
